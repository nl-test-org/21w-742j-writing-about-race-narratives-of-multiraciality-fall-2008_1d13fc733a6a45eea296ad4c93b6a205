Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

In this course we will read essays, novels, memoirs, and graphic texts, and view documentary and experimental films and videos which explore race from the standpoint of the multiracial. Examining the varied work of multiracial authors and filmmakers such as Danzy Senna, Ruth Ozeki, Kip Fulbeck, James McBride and others, we will focus not on how multiracial people are seen or imagined by the dominant culture, but instead on how they represent themselves. How do these authors approach issues of family, community, nation, language and history? What can their work tell us about the complex interconnections between race, gender, class, sexuality, and citizenship? Is there a relationship between their experiences of multiraciality and a willingness to experiment with form and genre? In addressing these and other questions, we will endeavor to think and write more critically and creatively about race as a social category and a lived experience.

Class Assignments
-----------------

This is a writing-centered course. Students will write a one-page response paper for each assigned text. There will also be two longer writing assignments: a 7-8 page critical essay responding to readings and screenings from the first month of the course, and a 12-15 page personal essay in which you will incorporate what you have learned through our critical/theoretical discussions of assigned texts into a creative exploration of your own experience – what Cherrie Moraga has called "theory in the flesh." In addition, there will be short in-class writing exercises over the course of the semester.

Regular class participation is required. Students are expected to come to each session prepared to discuss the day's texts, and every student will lead one class discussion. In addition, you will be expected to provide productive feedback on your peer's manuscripts during workshops.

Workshops
---------

There will be three writing workshops during the semester in which students will break up into small groups and discuss each other's critical and personal essays as works-in-progress.

Grading
-------

You will receive individual grades for the two essays. Your final grade will be based upon these essays, the other contents of your portfolio (response papers and in-class assignments) and on your participation in class discussions and workshops.
